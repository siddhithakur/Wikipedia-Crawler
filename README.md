Lisiting 'n' important sentences related to the search phrase in chronlogical order


This is one of the codes I was told to write in an early competition with following instructions
1. Given some input word or phrase, figure out all relevant Wikipedia articles. If thereâ€™s
nothing relevant, return null.
2. Create a timeline from these articles. To do that, extract all sentences with dates (&
temporal words like yesterday, tomorrow, etc). Return only best n (NOT necessarily first
n) sentences in timeline in chronological order. [we leave it up to how you infer best]
3. Create a microservice (BONUS: host it on Heroku or similar) which takes some
word/phrase and a number n as input, & returns these
a. All relevant Wikipedia page name (return null if irrelevant)
b. Best n timeline sentences
